# Federated-Learning

Sometimes centrally collecting data produced by edge devices, such as mobile phones or cars, is infeasible or undesirable.
With federated learning, clients collaboratively train a model under the direction of a server,
while keeping the training data decentralized and mitigating privacy risks. Learn how you can use TensorFlow Federated, 
an open-source framework for machine learning and other computations on decentralized data, to explore federated learning.
In this workshop, you will train an image classification model and a text generation model while learning about the unique advantages
and challenges of the federated setting. You will also see examples of how TFF can be used to enable new research.
After this tutorial, you will be equipped to further experiment with federated learning on your own.
